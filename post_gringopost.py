DESCRIPTION = """Hello, dear expats!

My name is Dr. Priscila Matovelle, and I specialize in Geriatrics and Palliative Care. I’m originally from Cuenca, where I studied medicine before continuing my training in Spain, where I also earned my Ph.D. in elderly care.

After years of international experience, I recently returned to Cuenca, and I’m excited to offer high-quality, compassionate medical care to the expat community. 

I understand how challenging it can be to navigate healthcare in a foreign country—I lived in Virginia Beach for a year, so I truly empathize with those challenges.

Medical Services:
– Comprehensive specialized care for adults over 65 years of age.
– Pre-surgical frailty assessment and post-surgical follow-up.
– Diagnosis and management of acute and chronic diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, thyroid disorders, among others.
– Geriatric syndromes: Malnutrition, dysmobility, loss of muscle mass, falls, incontinence, polypharmacy, chronic pain.
– Cognitive disorders: Memory loss, dementia/Alzheimer’s disease.
– Depression, anxiety, emotional disturbance, Insomnia.
– Geriatric and oncological palliative care

I offer home visits, online or consultations at my office in Hospital Monte Sinaí, Tower I, office 403. 

If you or a loved one need expert care, I’m here to help. 

Contact me at: 098 063 4974

Looking forward to meeting you and supporting your health and wellness here in Cuenca or anywhere in the world!
